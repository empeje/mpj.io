# Motivation

I'm not a computer science (CS) graduate, but I remember taking a CS class online and the professor starts with motivation. I want to start this Readme with motivation as well.

I'm working in tech for a few years now, but I lost in a flurry of activity. I feel like most of my time spent working, but my work is not "creating" something new and valuable for the tech community. I want to do a transformation from being a tech-worker to a tech-creator. This website is the first step to contribute to the greater good.

For those who follow me, the reason I want to be a tech-creator is not for the tech-creator itself, but I enjoy building useful things. If what I do makes me happy, that's enough. So, if you want to be a tech-creator for the sake of becoming one with no other motivation, please rethink.

# Requirements

I have several requirements for my *upcoming* website.

- Internationalization. It should provide at least two languages, English and Bahasa Indonesia. I write in these two languages and it is important to write in both languages as my audience in Indonesia might not fluent in English but I still want to reach them. Also, in the future, I might be learning a new language, so having an internationalization framework in-place is important.
- Content. I want to provide articles, videos (from YouTube or maybe other places, who knows), codes, academic publications, and books.
- It should be able to aggregate my writing in several places. I write in Medium, Codementor, Dev.to, and many more. If I write on the external sites, I want to let the original content there and have a hyperlink available on my site to the article.
